I'm very passionate about writing tests to ensure code quality and achieve better software design. When I started iOS development one of the first things I did was evaluating testing frameworks for iOS.

### How it started out...

It didn't take long to setup [GHUnit](https://github.com/gabriel/gh-unit), [OCMock](http://ocmock.org/) and [OCHamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/OCHamcrest). This combination allows unit testing, mocking and provides a better assertion syntax. I was very excited and [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/#!/MattesGroeger/status/167993966342569987). On this tweet I got a very interesting reply from my friend [Maxim](https://twitter.com/#!/iceX33):

This made me curios. I started using [Kiwi](https://github.com/allending/Kiwi) for my recent iOS project and [fell more and more in love with it](https://twitter.com/#!/MattesGroeger/status/176436609984643072).

### Presentation

In the following video I give a brief introduction to Kiwi and what makes it so special. It was captured during one of our `5-Minutes-of-Fame` talks at [Wooga](http://www.wooga.com/).
